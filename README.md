# Diabetes Prediction
# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a diabetes prediction model using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on certain medical attributes. The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains multiple features related to medical tests.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`
  - `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`
  - `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used in the project.
- `models/`
  - Contains the saved trained models.
- `main.py`: Script to run the prediction using the saved models.
- `README.md`: Description of the project (this file).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
